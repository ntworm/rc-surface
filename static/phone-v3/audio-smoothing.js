 * audio-smoothing.js — adaptive low-pass filter for audio signals.
 *
 * Two pure functions exposed via `window.AudioSmoothing`:
 *   - smoothAudioValue(prev, raw)         // adaptive-alpha smoothing for any signal
 *   - gainSmoothedRms(prev, raw, alpha, gain=RMS_GAIN) // RMS-specific: amplify + clamp + smooth
 *
 * Why adaptive alpha:
 *   A fixed-alpha smoothing treats quiet and loud signals identically. The
 *   dominant complaint at rest is RMS jitter from background noise. Weighting
 *   the previous sample more heavily when raw is small fixes that without
 *   slowing down transients.
 *   Formula: `alpha = 0.08 + min(0.5, raw * 2)`
 *     raw = 0.0   → alpha = 0.08  (retain 92% — anti-jitter)
 *     raw = 0.25  → alpha = 0.58  (retain 42% — transients pass)
 *     raw ≥ 0.25  → alpha = 0.58  (clamped)
 *
 * Why RMS-specific gain:
 *   Phone mics deliver raw RMS in the 0.01–0.05 range for everyday signals.
 *   The admin bar clamps at 1.0 but the perceptually useful range is 0.0–0.3.
 *   A 3× input gain brings "speech level" up to 0.15–0.45 — readable on the
 *   bar and useful for mapping — while still clamping saturated peaks at 1.0.
 *   Gain affects only the signal fed into the smoother; the alpha curve is
 *   computed from the *raw* value, not the amplified one, so noise suppression
 *   at silence is unchanged.
 *
 * Loaded as a plain <script> before app.js. Exposes
 * `window.AudioSmoothing.{smoothAudioValue, gainSmoothedRms}`.
