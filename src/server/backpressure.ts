/**
 * backpressure.ts — Per-connection backpressure monitor.
 *
 * The identity model (client_id + session, not IP) and the thresholds below
 * are the contract the phone clients and the server tests both rely on.
 *
 * Watches `ws.bufferedAmount` and takes progressive action:
 *   1. Above BACKPRESSURE_DROP_THRESHOLD  → skip non-critical outbound messages.
 *   2. Above BACKPRESSURE_DISCONNECT_THRESHOLD → close the socket.
 *
 * Identity model: clients are keyed by `client_id` + session (WebSocket
 * instance), not by IP. Two phones behind the same NAT each keep their
 * own session. A reconnecting phone only replaces its *own* prior
 * session (matched by client_id).
