// client_update used to carry every history ring for every control on every
// send. With a dashboard open that is ~100 KB of mostly-unchanged samples at
// 20 Hz — enough on its own to push the socket past the backpressure drop
// threshold, which then starts discarding the telemetry it is drowning in.
//
// The rings now go out in full once, when a dashboard connects, and as a
// delta after that. The delta is keyed off a monotonic per-control counter,
// not off array length: the ring rotates, so after a rotation the length is
// unchanged while the contents moved underneath.
