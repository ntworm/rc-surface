// Re-entrancy guard for the WriteScheduler.
//
// applyMappedValue() enqueues and then immediately awaits flush(). While a
// flush is in flight (awaiting a Live setValue) every other flush() call
// returns straight away because of the isFlushing latch. Anything enqueued in
// that window therefore depends on the in-flight flush to drain it — if the
// in-flight flush only walks the key snapshot it took when it started, the
// newest write is stranded until some unrelated control moves again.
//
// The stranded write is the LAST one of a gesture (fader released, hand left
// the frame), i.e. exactly the value the performer expects to hear.
