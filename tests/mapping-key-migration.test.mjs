// a binding belonged to, and it makes no sense at all once the surface is
// shared: `fader-1` has to mean one thing no matter who touches it.
//
// Legacy keys are folded into their global control on load. Where a global
// binding already exists it wins — it is the one the panel has been showing —
// and the discarded per-phone binding is reported rather than dropped in
// silence, because losing a mapping without being told is how a set goes wrong
// on stage.
